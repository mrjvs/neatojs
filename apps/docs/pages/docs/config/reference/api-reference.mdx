# API reference

## `createConfig(options)`

This is the main function of the library. It takes a few options and returns the final configuration object.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  envPrefix: 'APP_',
  loaders: [
    loaders.environment(),
    loaders.file('.env'),
  ],
  schema: z.object({
    server: z.object({
      port: z.coerce.number(),
      host: z.string().default('localhost'),
    }),
  }),
});
```

<Field title="loaders" type="KeyLoader[]" required>
  The list of loaders to use. The loaders are the source of the final configuration object. If you have no loaders, the configuration will an empty object.

  You can import `loaders` from `@neato/config` to use the [built-in loaders](#loaders). You can also create your own loaders by implementing the `KeyLoader` type, [read more about plugins](../guide/plugins.mdx).

  Find all the built-in loaders [here](../api/loaders.mdx).
</Field>
<Field title="schema" type="SchemaTransformer<T> | ZodSchema | JoiSchema">
  The schema to use for validation and transformation of the configuration object. The schema is used to validate the final configuration object and transform it to the expected type.

  You can use Zod, Joi or custom schemas. The schema is optional, but it is recommended to use it to ensure the configuration is valid and has the expected types.

  Naming conventions are automatically detected from the schema, read more [about naming conventions here](../guide/going-deeper.mdx#naming-convention-detection).
</Field>
<Field title="envPrefix" type="string">
  This is the prefix to use for environment variables. The prefix is used to filter the environment variables that are loaded by the environment variable based loaders.

  The prefix is stripped from the environment variable names before they are processed. This means that if you have an environment variable `APP_SERVER__PORT`, it will be parsed as `SERVER__PORT`.
</Field>
<Field title="unfreeze" type="boolean">
  This option is used to unfreeze the configuration object. By default, the configuration object is deep frozen to prevent accidental mutations. If you set this option to `true`, the configuration object will not be frozen and can be mutated.
</Field>
<Field title="assert" type="string | ((error: NeatConfigError) => void)">
  This option is used to handle errors. By default, the library will exit with a colored and formatted error message in the console. You can change this behaviour by setting the `assert` option to `plain` (plain text) or `throw` (throws an error).

  Alternatively, you can set this option to a function that will be called with the error object. Use this to implement custom error handling logic, such as logging the error to a file or sending it to an external service.

  Read more about [error handling here](../guide/error-handling.mdx).
</Field>
<Field title="namingConvention" type="NamingConventionFunc">
  This option is used to set the naming convention for the configuration object. By default, the library will detect the naming convention from the schema. If you don't have a schema you can use this option to set the default naming convention.

  There are a few [built-in naming conventions](#naming), you can use those or create your own by passing a function.
</Field>
<Field title="presetKey" type="string">
  When using presets, this is they key used to identify which presets to load. It defaults to `configPresets`, meaning you can use `CONFIG_PRESETS=abc,foo` to load the `abc` and `foo` presets.

  You don't need to set this option if you are not using presets.
</Field>
<Field title="presets" type="Record<string, Preset>">
  An object containing the presets to use. Presets are a way to make standardize your configuration and make it easier to use in different environments. You can use presets to load different configurations for different environments, such as local development, dev containers, or similar.
</Field>

# `zodCoercedBoolean()`

This utility function is used to create a Zod primitive that coerces a string value to a boolean. It is used to handle boolean values in the configuration object.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  loaders: [
    loaders.environment(),
  ],
  schema: z.object({
    serverPort: z.coerce.number(),
    useStrictHeaders: zodCoercedBoolean().default(false),
  }),
});
```

# `loaders` - Built-in loaders

Loaders are the source of the final configuration object. To load anything into your configuration you must specify at least one loader.

## `loaders.environment()`

This loader loads environment variables from `process.env` into the configuration object. It respects the `envPrefix` option if specified.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  envPrefix: 'APP_',
  loaders: [
    loaders.environment(),
  ],
});
```

## `loaders.file(path, options?)`

This loader loads configuration from a file. It supports the following file types:
- `JSON`
- `ENV` - Respects the `envPrefix` option if specified.

You can also specify a file type if it can't be detected automatically. The file type is used to determine how to parse the file.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  envPrefix: 'APP_',
  loaders: [
    loaders.file('.env'),
    loaders.file('config.json'),
    loaders.file('config.txt', { type: 'JSON' }),
  ],
});
```

## `loaders.cli(options)`

This loader loads configuration from the command line arguments. You must set a prefix for it to work.

It supports both `--key value` and `--key=value` formats.

The prefix is stripped from the key before it is processed. So with a prefix of `app-`, the CLI argument `--app-server__port=8080` will be parsed as `server.port=8080`.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  loaders: [
    loaders.cli({ prefix: 'app-' }),
  ],
});
```

## `loaders.dir(path, options?)`

This loader loads in data from a directory structure, the filename is used as the key and the contents of the file is the value

Optionally a prefix can be set to strip from the key before it is processed.

```ts title="Example"
const config = createConfig({
  loaders: [
    loaders.dir("/var/run/secrets", { prefix: 'APP_' }),
  ],
});
```

# `naming` - Built-in naming conventions

The library comes with a few built-in naming conventions.

## `naming.camelCase`

This naming convention uses camel case for the keys. It is the default naming convention.

Camel case looks like this: `camelCase`, `myKey`, `anotherKey`

## `naming.pascalCase`

This naming convention uses pascal case for the keys.

Pascal case looks like this: `PascalCase`, `MyKey`, `AnotherKey`

## `naming.screamingSnakeCase`

This naming convention uses screaming snake case for the keys.

Screaming snake case looks like this: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, `MY_KEY`, `ANOTHER_KEY`

## `naming.snakeCase`

This naming convention uses snake case for the keys.

Snake case looks like this: `snake_case`, `my_key`, `another_key`
