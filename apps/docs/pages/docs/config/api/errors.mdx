# Error handling

Configuration loading has some potentionally confusing error handling.
By default, it will use the "pretty" assertion mode. This mode **will call process.exit(1)** instead of throwing errors. That means that you aren't able to catch it with a try-catch block.

## The modes
 - `pretty` Log the errors in pretty formatting and colors, then exit the process.
 - `plain` Log the errors in plain text, then exit the process.
 - `throw` throw the errors where they occur.
