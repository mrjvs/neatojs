# Making pages

On this page, you will learn how to write content pages in Guider.


## Create a new page

Guider uses file system routing from Next.JS, this means the folder structure of in your `pages` directory
directly corresponds to the final URL of your page.

A few examples:
- `/pages/hello/world.mdx` becomes `example.com/hello/world`
- `/pages/goodbye/moon/index.mdx` becomes `example.com/goodbye/moon`

<Tip>
You can use both `.md` and `.mdx` extension for your content files.

## Linking your page to a theme

In your theme file, you will have configured sites, directories and maybe layouts. If you only have one directory and site,
then there will be no need to link anything explicitly.

If you have multiple sites or directories, you will need to specify which pages belong to which directory/site.
If unspecified, the first site and directory is chosen from your theme.

You can choose a site/directory with a `_meta.json` file.
If you have a meta file inside of `/pages/hello/_meta.json` then it will apply to all pages starting with `/hello`.

A example meta file:
```json title="/pages/hello/_meta.json"
{
  "site": "site-a",
  "directory": "dir-a",
  "layout": "default"
}
```

You can omit any field in this file and it will default to a upper level (like `/pages/_meta.json`) or just use the default.

If you don't want to apply these settings to an entire directory but just a single page. You can also specify all options that are available in a meta file inside of the Frontmatter of the page:
```md
---
site: "site-a"
directory: "dir-a"
layout: "default"
---
# My heading
my paragraph
```

Just like the meta file, you can omit any field for it to default to an upper level.

## Creating a page that doesn't use MDX or MD

If you want to run other pages that aren't related to your documentation, you can simply make `.jsx` or `.tsx` files in the pages directory.

It will be a completely blank page by default, if you want to still use the general layout of a site. You can use `<GuiderLayout />{:tsx}` to make use of the standard layout.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { GuiderLayout } from '@neato/guider/client';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <GuiderLayout meta={{ site: 'my-site' }}>
      <p>My page goes here</p>
    </GuiderLayout>
  );
}
```


## Writing in MD or MDX

Guider uses most of [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). If you are familiar with it, you can use everything you know.

If you aren't familiar, you can refer to [Basic text](/docs/guider/writing/basic-text) to learn how to write in Markdown.
