# Steps

If you have a number of steps for a reader to follow, the steps component is a great choice.


## General usage

You can make steps by making a container `<Steps>{:tsx}` component with any number of `<Steps.Step>{:tsx}` inside them.

You can put any content inside of a step, so don't feel restricted to just text. Steps work great with a level 3 heading as the first element.

````tsx
<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Step one
    Step content goes here
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Step two
    Step content goes here
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>
````

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Step one
    Step content goes here
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Step two
    Step content goes here
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>
