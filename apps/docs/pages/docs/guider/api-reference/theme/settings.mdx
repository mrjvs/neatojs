# Layout settings

Layout settings are the interface on which you modify your layout.

All of these settings can be changed in any settings layer, [read more about settings layers](../../guides/advanced/customizing-layout.mdx).


## Example

```tsx
settings: {
  toc: false,
  colors: {
    primary: '#f76957',
  }
}
```


## About partials

Partial settings work slightly differently than other settings:
- To overwrite a partial, pass in a function (e.g. `toc: () => <p>hello</p>{:tsx}`). This will also **show** the partial.
- Set a partial to `true{:tsx}` to **show** the partial, but not change its contents (e.g. `toc: true{:tsx}`).
- Set a partial to `false{:tsx}` to **hide** the partial, but not change its contents (e.g. `toc: false{:tsx}`).
- To use the settings from the upper layer. Just don't set the settings (or set it to undefined).

You can read more about layout partials in the [layout settings guide](../../guides/advanced/customizing-layout.mdx).

When you overwrite a partial, you can use `useGuiderPage()` to get the current page information. ([Read more here](../functions/use-guider-page.mdx)).
