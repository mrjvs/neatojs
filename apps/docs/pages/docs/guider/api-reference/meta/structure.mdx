# Structure of `_meta.json`

Find out the structure of the `_meta.json` file.


## The file

The `_meta.json` file can created and placed in any folder in the `/pages` directory.

The meta file will be applied to all routes and child routes of the folder.

<Tip>
  All fields inside the meta file can also be specified in the Frontmatter of a page, so you don't need to make a meta file for a single page.
