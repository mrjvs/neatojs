## Migration steps

 1. **Make a guider project:** Make a new guider project by following [this guide](../installation.mdx).
 2. **Copy your markdown files over:** Copy over all Markdown files into the pages directory of the new project.
    - Remove the numbers prefixed on front of your files and folders. The order is now in the theme config.
    - Replace the component directives with MDX React components.
    - Update frontmatter to set the layout ID instead of modifying the layout settings directly. See [this page](../../advanced/customizing-layout.mdx).
    - Replace title in the frontmatter to a link in the theme config.
 3. **Migrate _dir.yml files:** dir files don't exist in Guider. Check these steps:
    - title goes in a `group()` in the theme config.
    - replace `navigation.redirect` with a `createRedirect()` in a index.tsx
    - title template can be set globally, not a per directory basis.
 4. **Migrate app.config.ts:** The settings in Guider go into the theme config, along with your sidebar contents.
 5. **Migrate vue components to react:** Guider is based in react, so to have custom components work you will need to port them.
 6. **Finished:** That should be everything to migrate to Guider, congratulations!
