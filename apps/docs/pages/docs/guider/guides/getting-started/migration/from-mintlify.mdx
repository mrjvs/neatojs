## Migration steps

1. **Make a guider project:** Make a new guider project by following [this guide](../installation.mdx).
2. **Copy your MDX files over:** Copy over all MDX files into the pages directory of the new project.
3. **Remove or replace unsupported components:** Not all components are supported by Guider. Check the compatibility table above.
4. **Migrate `mint.json` file:** In Mintlify, the json file is used for all configuration. In Guider this is done in the theme config. [Check out this guide](../../config/navigation.mdx).
5. **Update frontmatter:** Mintlify has some configuration in the frontmatter. Remove the unsupported properties or move them to the theme config.
6. **Finished:** That should be everything to migrate to Guider, congratulations!
