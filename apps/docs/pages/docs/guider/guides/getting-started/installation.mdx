<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Create a Next.JS project and install Guider
    To install a Next.JS project with guider, install the following dependencies:
    ```sh npm2yarn
    npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest @neato/guider@latest
    ```
    then add the following scripts to your `package.json`:
    ```json title="package.json" showLineNumbers
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Add a Next.JS config
    Create or replace the following `next.config.mjs` file in your project's root directory.
    ```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers
    import { guider } from "@neato/guider";

    const withGuider = guider({
      // The location of your theme file, created in the next step
      themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx',
    });

    export default withGuider({
      // These are the normal Next.JS settings.
      // Check out Next.JS docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js
      output: 'export',
    });
    ```
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Create a theme config
    Next, create a `theme.config.tsx`. This will be the home for all of your configuration and customization of Guider:
    ```ts title="theme.config.tsx" showLineNumbers
    import { defineTheme, directory, link } from '@neato/guider/theme';

    export default defineTheme({
      directories: [
        directory("main", { // ID of your directory (unique per site), used for referencing in your page files
          sidebar: [
            // Creates a link in your sidebar, add more below it
            link("Home", "/")
          ]
        })
      ],
    });
    ```
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Create entrypoint files
    Finally, create two files `pages/_app.tsx` and `pages/404.tsx`. They should be in your pages directory.
    The app file is to setup the layout system and styled for Guider. The 404 file holds a preset "page not found" view, feel free to customize it.
    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeGroup.Code title="pages/_app.tsx">
        ```tsx
        import '@neato/guider/style.css';
        import { createGuiderApp } from '@neato/guider/client';

        export default createGuiderApp();
        ```
      </CodeGroup.Code>
      <CodeGroup.Code title="pages/404.tsx">
        ```tsx
        import { createNotFoundPage } from '@neato/guider/client';

        export default createNotFoundPage();
        ```
      </CodeGroup.Code>
    </CodeGroup>
  </Steps.Step>
  <Steps.Step>
    ### Ready to write documentation!
    Your project has been fully setup, all that's left is to fill it with content. Try it out by making a file in your pages directory:
    ```md title="pages/index.mdx"
    # Hello world
    This is my first `@neato/guider` page!
    ```
    And run with `npm run dev{:sh}` and see your first page by visiting the link shown in the console.
    <Note>
      The Next.JS development server is infamous for being slow. The final build of the site will be **much** faster.
    </Note>
