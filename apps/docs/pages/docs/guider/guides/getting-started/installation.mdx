        ### Run the automatic installer
        Start the installer by running this command:
        ```sh
        npx @neato/create-guider
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Install dependencies
        Navigate to the directory the installer made and run the following:
        ```sh npm2yarn
        npm install
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Ready to write!
        Your project has been fully setup, all that's left is to fill it with content.

        Run the developer server with `npm run dev{:sh}` and see the first page by visiting the link shown in the console.
        <Note>
          The Next.JS development server is infamous for being slow. The final build of the site will be **much** faster.

            "dev": "next dev",
            "build": "next build",
            "start": "next start",

          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Add a Next.JS config
        Create or replace the following `next.config.mjs` file in your project's root directory.
        ```js title="next.config.mjs" showLineNumbers
        import { guider } from "@neato/guider";

        const withGuider = guider({
          // The location of your theme file, created in the next step
          themeConfig: './theme.config.tsx',
        });

        export default withGuider({
          // These are the normal Next.JS settings.
          // Check out Next.JS docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js
          output: 'export',
        });
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Create a theme config
        Next, create a `theme.config.tsx`. This will be the home for all of your configuration and customization of Guider:
        ```ts title="theme.config.tsx" showLineNumbers
        import { defineTheme, directory, link } from '@neato/guider/theme';

        export default defineTheme({
          directories: [
            directory("main", { // ID of your directory (unique per site), used for referencing in your page files
              sidebar: [
                // Creates a link in your sidebar, add more below it
                link("Home", "/")
              ]
            })
          ],
        });
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Create entrypoint files
        Finally, create two files `pages/_app.tsx` and `pages/404.tsx`. They should be in your pages directory.
        The app file is to setup the layout system and styled for Guider. The 404 file holds a preset "page not found" view, feel free to customize it.
        <CodeGroup>
          <CodeGroup.Code title="pages/_app.tsx">
            ```tsx
            import '@neato/guider/style.css';
            import { createGuiderApp } from '@neato/guider/client';

            export default createGuiderApp();
            ```
          </CodeGroup.Code>
          <CodeGroup.Code title="pages/404.tsx">
            ```tsx
            import { createNotFoundPage } from '@neato/guider/client';

            export default createNotFoundPage();
            ```
          </CodeGroup.Code>
        </CodeGroup>
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Setup typescript
        To make Guider work, you will need to slightly modify your tsconfig.json. If you don't have a tsconfig.json file yet, just make one at the root of your project.

        If you do already have typescript, you can just change the single option in your existing config.

        ```json title="tsconfig.json"
        {
          "compilerOptions": {
            "moduleResolution": "Bundler", // [!code focus]
          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        ### Ready to write documentation!
        Your project has been fully setup, all that's left is to fill it with content. Try it out by making a file in your pages directory:
        ```md title="pages/index.mdx"
        # Hello world
        This is my first `@neato/guider` page!
        ```
        And run with `npm run dev{:sh}` and see your first page by visiting the link shown in the console.
        <Note>
          The Next.JS development server is infamous for being slow. The final build of the site will be **much** faster.
