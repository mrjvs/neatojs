# Colors & theme

Guider has been designed fit almost any use case for documentation.
Naturally, this means that there are lots of configuration options to provide the flexibility Guider offers.

Usually, the first thing to change is the branding.

## Introduction to layout settings

Layout settings can be modified on three layers, each one overriding settings from a previous layer. The layers are as follows:
- **Site layout settings:** The base layer of layout settings is simply on `Site.settings`.
- **Layout settings:** The second layer that counts is on a layout itself at `Layout.settings`.
- **Directory layout settings:** The last layer is on a directory at `Directory.settings`.

All of these layers are resolved in order. So if you have something specified on the directory layer, it will overwrite all other layers.
If you specify something on the layout layer, it will overwrite the site layer but not the directory layer.

```ts title="Layer examples"
site('main', {
  settings: {
    toc: false,
    sidebar: false,
  }
  directories: [
    directory("main", {
      layout: "test-layout"
      sidebar: [
        link("Home", "/")
      ],
      settings: {
        toc: false,
      }
    })
  ],
  layouts: [
    layout('test-layout', {
      settings: {
        toc: true,
        sidebar: true,
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

In this example, the final result will be `toc == false{:ts}` because the directory settings have the highest priority and `sidebar == true{:ts}` because the settings in layouts are a higher priority than the site settings.

## Changing colors

Now that you know how layout settings are resolved. We can start customising the colors and other layout settings:

```ts
settings: {
  colors: {
    // Main theme colors
    primary: '#50A0EA', // Primary color of the site
    primaryDarker: '#1B65A9', // A darker variant of primary color
    primaryLighter: '#89C6FF', // A lighter variant of the primary color
    text: '#668896', // Normal text color
    textLighter: '#9AB3BD', // Slightly lighter text color
    textHighlight: '#FFFFFF', // Heading and highlight text color.
    background: '#050F13', // Main page background color
    backgroundLighter: '#07171C', // Lighter background color for code blocks and such
    backgroundLightest: '#081E24', // Lightest background color for hover effects
    backgroundDark: '#040C0F' // Darker variant of the background color
    line: '#0F2B33', // Color of all lines

    // Colors in code blocks
    codeWarning: '#222D20', // Codeblock background for a warning annotation
    codeError: '#2B1B1F', // Codeblock background for a error annotation and diff remove
    codeGreen: '#0B2823', // Codeblock background for a diff add
    codeHighlight: '#0E2429', // Codeblock background for a highlighted line
    codeWordHighlight: '#365C68', // Background of a highlighted word in a codeblock

    // Semantic colors - Primarily used in callouts
    // The lighter variants are used for text colors in callouts
    semanticTip: '#39B864',
    semanticTipLighter: '#75F2B6',
    semanticNote: '#817EF3',
    semanticNoteLighter: '#B9B8FC',
    semanticImportant: '#A958E8',
    semanticImportantLighter: '#D3A2F9',
    semanticWarning: '#C0BC43',
    semanticWarningLighter: '#ECE873',
    semanticCaution: '#FC6359',
    semanticCautionLighter: '#FFA59F',
  }
}
```

## Changing the logo

If just want to modify the site name and homepage link, you can simple change it in site configuration:
```ts
site('site-id', {
  logo: {
    to: '/',
    name: 'My docs'
  },
  // ... other settings
})
```

If you want to fully customize how your logo looks (For example, using an image as your logo), you can overwrite the full partial in **any settings layer**:
```tsx
settings: {
  logo: () => <p>My logo</p>
}
```


## Enabling the background pattern

You can optionally enable a fancy looking background pattern. It uses your configured primary colors.

```tsx
settings: {
  backgroundPattern: 'flare'
}
```

There are currently no other options other than `flare` and just having it disabled.

  ## Want to build a theme?

  Give the color wheel a spin and generate a theme for your documentation.

  If you want more freedom, you can also use this as a base for you main theme and just customize where neccesary.

  ```json
  CODE
  ```
</ThemerContainer>
