# Navigation

Guider has many possibilities in navigation. This page will go through
all methods and how to use them to their full potentional.


## Filling the sidebar

The sidebar is the most expressive out of all the navigation structures.

You can use the following components, all of which are imported from `@neato/guider/theme`.
- `link(){:ts}`: A standard sidebar link with optional icon.
- `link.nested(){:ts}`: A nested link, it's collapsable by the user.
- `group(){:ts}`: A group or section, used for visual hierarchy.
- `separator(){:ts}`: A plain & simple line.
- `component(){:ts}`: A custom component, you can render any React component in here.

<Note>
  Groups can contain any other components except another group. Nested links can only contain normal links and separators.
</Note>

Here is an example that uses every component. This sidebar configuration will
need to be added to the directory of your choosing.

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
sidebar: [
  link("Link A", "/link/a"),
  link("Link B with icon", "/link/b", { icon: 'fa6-solid:b' }),
  link.nested("Link C in group", [
    link("Link C.1", "/link/c/1"),
    link("Link C.2", "/link/c/2"),
  ]),
  link.nested("Link D in group", "/link/d", [
    link("Link D.1", "/link/d/1"),
    link("Link D.2", "/link/d/2"),
  ]),
  link.nested("Title", [
    link("Title", "/link"),
  ]),
  group("Group A", [
    link("Link E", "/link/e"),
  ])
  separator(),
  component(() => <p>Custom component</p>),
]
```


## Adding links to the header

Adding links to the navigation bar is quite easy.

You can use the following components, all of which are imported from `@neato/guider/theme`.
- `link(){:ts}`: A standard link with optional icon.
- `separator(){:ts}`: A plain & simple line.

You can configure the top navigation per site. Here is an example that uses every component:

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
site("my-site", {
  navigation: [
    link("Link A", "/link/a"),
    link("Link B with icon", "/link/b", { icon: 'fa6-solid:b' }),
    separator(),
    link("Link C", "/link/c"),
  ]
})
```


## Adding tabs

Sometimes you want to split up your documentation site into multiple sections. As an example, you can split it up between "Documentation" and "API reference". That's a perfect case for tabs.

You can use the following components, all of which are imported from `@neato/guider/theme`.
- `link(){:ts}`: A standard tab with optional icon.
- `component(){:ts}`: A custom component, you can render any React component in here.

You can configure tabs per site, here is an example that uses every component:

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
site("my-site", {
  tabs: [
    link("Link A", "/link/a"),
    link("Link B", "/link/b"),
    component(() => <p>Custom component</p>),
  ]
})
```


## A dropdown for your sites

In cases where you have multiple projects, all with seperate documentation sites, the dropdown may be a better fit than links in the top navigation.

You can use the following components, all of which are imported from `@neato/guider/theme`.
- `link(){:ts}`: A standard dropdown with optional icon.

You can configure the dropdown per site, here is an example that uses every component:

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
site("my-site", {
  dropdown: [
    link("Link A", "/link/a"),
    link("Link B", "/link/b"),
  ]
})
```
