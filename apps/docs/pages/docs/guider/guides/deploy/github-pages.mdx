# GitHub Pages

A GitHub Action to deploy a Guider documentation site.

## Prerequisites

- Enable GitHub Pages, go to `Your repo > Settings > Pages` and set `Source` to `GitHub Actions`.

## The workflow

Add this code to a file in the github workflows folder, for example: `/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`.

There are highlighted words in the code, double check if those match your environment.
This code sample assumes you use `npm`, with the branch `main` as your release branch and the docs being in the root of your repository.

```yml title=".github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml"
name: "docs-deploy"

on:
  push:
    branches:
     # [!code word:main:1]
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # [!code word:npm]
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20
        cache: 'npm'

    # [!code word:./]
    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ./
      run: npm ci

    - name: Build
      working-directory: ./
      run: npm run build

    - name: Upload
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: ./out

  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

<Note>
