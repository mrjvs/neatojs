# Customising layout

The flexibilty of Guider really shines with its overwritable partials.


## Partials

Partials are sections of the interface, you can replace them and toggle them at will.
Here are all possibilities:
 - `toc`: The table of contents section.
 - `sidebar`: The sidebar navigation menu.
 - `navigation`: The header navigation menu.
 - `contentFooter`: The content footer, placed right below content.
 - `pageEnd`: The navigation links below the content, but above the content footer.
 - `pageFooter`: The page footer, placed at the very bottom of the page. Disabled by default.
 - `logo`: The logo, shown in the navigation bar and page footer.
 - `pageLayout`: The entire page, cannot be turned off.


## Turning partials on or off

You can turn off any partial on or off at [any layout settings level](/docs/guider/guides/config/theming#introduction-to-layout-settings).
Simply set the partial to `true{:ts}` or `false{:ts}`. Here is an example with the sidebar:

```tsx
settings: {
  sidebar: false,
}
```

This will turn off the sidebar for that settings level.


## Overwriting the partial

You can replace any partial with your own component at [any layout settings level](/docs/guider/guides/config/theming#introduction-to-layout-settings).
Just set the partial to your component function - this will also enable it at the same time. Here is an example that overwrites the logo:

```tsx
settings: {
  logo: () => <p>My Company<p>,
}
```

If you are making a more complex partial that needs to display another partial, you can use the theme components (e.g. `<GuiderSidebar />{:tsx}`).
Find all of them in the API reference tab.

## The default layouts

The default layouts will always be present. They can not be removed but they can be overwritten. Just add a layout with the same ID as the
default layout of your choice. These are the defaults:
- `default`: The default layout of every page
- `page`: Layout for simple pages without sidebar, TOC or content footer.
- `article`: Layout for articles, without a sidebar or content footer.
- `raw`: Layout for when you just want to make a raw page without any of the other layouts.
