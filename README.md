# NeatoJS

- typescript first
- modular
- isolated, use the packages on their own
- no abstraction, you're using well-known libraries, almost no need for neato-specific google searches

## Packages
- @neato/config - load configurations from various sources with type-safety and validation (BETA)
- @neato/guider - beautiful documentation generator framework based on nextjs (ALPHA)

## Upcoming packages
- @neato/router - http router based on fastify
- @neato/auth - fully fledged authentication system, including permissions
- @neato/jobs - persistent job queue
- @neato/log - simple logger with good pretty defaults
